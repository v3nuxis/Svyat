> Citizen Services & Government Analytics

## Background...

You are designing a database for a GOVERNMENT CITIZEN SERVICES SYSTEM.
This system helps track \*\*citizen demographics, public services usage, infrastructure maintenance, and social programs

The government wants to analyze:

- Demographic trends (age, employment, education levels, etc.)
- How citizens interact with government services
- Infrastructure maintenance efficiency
- Effectiveness of social programs

## Task 1: Database Schema Design

Design a relational database schema that supports citizen records, services, and infrastructure tracking.

Required Tables:

1. Citizens (`citizens`) ‚Üí Stores basic information like name, age, address, employment status, and education level.
2. Public Services (`public_services`) ‚Üí Lists government services (e.g., healthcare, education, unemployment benefits).
3. Service Usage (`service_usage`) ‚Üí Tracks which citizens use which services, when, and how often.
4. Infrastructure (`infrastructure`) ‚Üí Stores public infrastructure (roads, schools, hospitals) and their maintenance history.
5. Social Programs (`social_programs`) ‚Üí Tracks government programs (e.g., housing assistance, scholarships).
6. Program Enrollment (`program_enrollment`) ‚Üí Records which citizens are enrolled in which programs.
7. Government Employees (`gov_employees`) ‚Üí Tracks government workers managing services and infrastructure.

You can pass your homework just as an IMAGE with your relations on a paper or a screenshot from any other application that allows you to visualize the relationship between tables (even Google Sheets üòÅ)

## Task 2:

- Install PostgreSQL Server on your Computer
- Insatll any PostgreSQL Client on your Computer
- Create a screenshot of connected client to your server

P.S. Task 2 is not related to the Task 1, so no need to create tables, but if this is better for you to do this with real database instead of drawing lines - it works for me either
