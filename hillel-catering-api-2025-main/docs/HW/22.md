- Implement User Activation Feature in the API
- The User Activation Feature:
    - GENERATES and SEND activation key via EMAIL (any provider you want)
    - exposes ENDPOINTS to
        - ACTIVATE USER
        - and RESEND ACTIVATION KEY if activation key is expired
    - uses CACHE client to store activation keys
        - P.S. You can use database to store this if you have any limitations on your machine and you can't install External Caching Services.
- The activation expiration time is configure with Django Settings
- The activation key is REMOVED from the cache on user activation
